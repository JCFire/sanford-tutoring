I'm Sandy,I am passionate about math. My aim is to provide a safe, friendly, fun environment where the studentwill not only be successful but also enjoy learning. I commit to offering your child the care and attention heneeds to succeed. I am patient, yet not content to let any student do less than their best. The pace will be tailoredto your child's individual needs. I enjoy working with kids from both ends of the spectrum - from those who arebehind to those who are seeking more of a challenge.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://sanfordtutoring.com/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sanfordtutoring.com/contact/</guid><description>Message sent!Have a question or want to know more?Leave me a Message belowFull Name:Phone Number:Email Address:Message:Send MessageOr reach me directlyPhone: (561) 654-1889Email: sandytiller@yahoo.comJust trying to find the place?5054 Knotty Pine Court,Sanford, FL 32771</description></item><item><title>Services</title><link>https://sanfordtutoring.com/services/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sanfordtutoring.com/services/</guid><description>TROUBLESHOOTINGAre you home educating and just need a little extra help with difficult concepts?

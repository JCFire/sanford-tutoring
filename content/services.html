      <div class="fs-6">
        Face-to-face and online instruction each offer unique benefits, addressing the diverse needs and preferences of individual students. 
        Sitting down to learn side-by-side allows for a more hands-on learning experience involving body-language and a direct feedback loop between the student and teacher, 
        while online learning capitalizes on the Flexibility, Accessibility, and Interactive Tools available over the internet.</div>

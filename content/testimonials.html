        <div class="card-text">I needed help with my 7th grade daughter. We were at an impasse, and Sandy came to the rescue.
          She took all of the emotion out of math, and with much patience, good humor, and kindness addressed my daughter's
          needs beautifully. She is now doing very well and has more self-confidence in math. Sandy has that rare blend
          of a calm demeanor, outstanding brainpower, and the ability to connect with a child who is struggling and make
          math understandable and relateable.</div>

        <div class="card-text">As parents of a homeschooled son, high school math seemed a daunting task we felt ill equipped
          to teach. Mrs. Tiller has assisted us in many ways, from helping us to pick the right curriculum to fit our son’s
          learning style, to preparing him to succeed in college level classes. We also saw his SAT scores increase through
          Mrs. Tiller’s tricks. Mrs. Tiller took time to understand how my son learns and really had an interest in his
          progress.

        <div class="card-text">My son has always struggled in math and with following directions. Because Sandy thoroughly
          goes over every step of each problem, my son is able to master the concepts. Noticeably, Sandy enjoys her students
          and the challenge of explaining what they cannot understand. She makes learning FUN for them. Sandy causes my
          son to confront each problem with great care until he 'gets' it. He looks forward to meeting with her because
          he knows he will be able to understand the rest of his week's assignments on his own after her teaching. Not
          only has Sandy helped my son improve his grades, but she has also given him confidence in his abilities.</div>

        <div class="card-text">Mrs. Tiller truly has a heart to help students succeed. She has helped me through all my
          high school math courses. What makes Mrs. Tiller such a wonderful tutor is that she makes sure you completely
          understand the concept long term, instead of just getting through that particular math problem. Mrs. Tiller is
          also very personable and presents math issues as a puzzle or game instead of dwelling on the issues or problems
          that come about.
